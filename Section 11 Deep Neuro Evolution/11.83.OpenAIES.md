# Open AI ES

This builds on the update rule from the PEPG-ES

- the Standard deviation is fixed
- The mean is the only thing that is updated

- there is 1 particularity
    - there is a modification of the update rule from PEPG-ES that is suitable for parallel computations

this is very very efficient for even more parameters than a PEPG-ES, since it has many worker machines solving AI problems

## Example
 There is a very difficult problem ain AI, which requires the AI to teach a humanoid AI to walk.

 Other AI ESs take a really long time to do so, but the OpenAI strategy took ~10 min
